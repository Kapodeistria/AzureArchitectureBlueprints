- **Clean Root Level**: Main deliverables (solution.md, quick-summary.md, performance-report.json) remain at root
- **Better Organization**: Separates user-facing documents from debugging/detailed agent outputs

### 📁 **New Folder Structure**
```

## 🐛 [3.2.3] - 2025-09-29 - **Memory Leak Fix & Satisfaction Target Update**

### 🐛 **Fixed EventEmitter Memory Leak**
- **Root Cause**: Each BaseAgent added 4 process listeners (exit, SIGINT, SIGTERM, uncaughtException)
- **Impact**: 11 agents = 44 listeners, exceeding Node.js default limit of 10 per event
- **Fix**: Global agent registry pattern with single set of cleanup handlers
- **Result**: Eliminated MaxListenersExceededWarning across all process event types

### 🎯 **Satisfaction Score Target Adjustment**
- **Updated Target**: 8.5/10 → 8.0/10 (more realistic for production architectures)
- **Increased Iterations**: Max 3 → Max 5 iterations for refinement loop
- **Improved Console Output**: Shows target score in progress messages

### 📊 **Better Visual Feedback**
```
📊 Initial Satisfaction Score: 7.2/10 (target: 8.0/10)
   WAF: 7.5/10, Cost: 6.8/10, Risk: 7.3/10
```

---

### 📋 **Improved WAF Coverage Display**
- **Graceful Fallback**: Clear message when WAF data not yet available
- **Helpful Guidance**: "Run `npm run local` for full WAF coverage analysis"
- **No More Confusion**: Eliminated misleading "0% coverage" display

---

## 🕐 [3.2.1] - 2025-09-29 - **Local Timezone Support**

### 🌍 **Local Timezone Implementation**
- **All Timestamps Local**: Folder names, file timestamps, reports now use system timezone
- **ISO 8601 Format**: Proper timezone offset included (e.g., +02:00 for Zurich)
- **Consistent Display**: Replaced all UTC timestamps with local time across entire system

### 📁 **Updated File Naming**
- **Folders**: `case-study-2025-09-29T22-30-45-summary/`
- **Reports**: `solution-2025-09-29T22-30-45.md`
- **Generated Times**: `Generated: 2025-09-29T22:30:45.123+02:00`

### 🔧 **New Utility Module**

## 🔄 [3.2.0] - 2025-09-29 - **Cost-Aware Refinement & Satisfaction Scoring**

### 🎯 **NEW: Post-Cost-Analysis Refinement Loop**
- **Cost-Aware Refinement Orchestrator**: Iterative architecture refinement incorporating WAF, cost, and risk feedback
- **Satisfaction Scoring System**: Combined metric (0-10) with weighted scoring (WAF 40%, Cost 30%, Risk 30%)
- **Target-Driven Iteration**: Automatically refines architecture until satisfaction ≥ 8.5/10 or max 3 iterations
- **Visual Diagram Regeneration**: Regenerates diagrams after each refinement to reflect optimizations
- **Comprehensive Iteration Tracking**: Saves detailed iteration reports showing improvement progression

### 📊 **Satisfaction Score Components**
- **WAF Compliance** (40% weight): Normalized from 0-100 to 0-10 scale
- **Cost Efficiency** (30% weight): Evaluates reserved instance usage, optimization opportunities, ROI
- **Risk Posture** (30% weight): Assesses critical/high risk count and mitigation strategies
- **Overall Target**: 8.5/10 minimum for production-ready architectures

### 🔧 **WAF Scoring Fixes**
- **Fixed Score Normalization**: Corrected 22.6/10 bug - all pillar scores now properly normalized to 0-10
- **Consistent Scale**: Overall WAF score on 0-100 scale, pillar scores on 0-10 scale
- **Accurate Reporting**: Executive summaries and reports now display correct score ranges

### 🔄 **Enhanced Workflow**
- **Step 2.1**: Initial WAF-only architecture refinement (existing)
- **Step 5**: Cost, risk, and change management analysis
- **Step 5.5**: **NEW** Cost-aware refinement loop with satisfaction scoring
- **Step 6**: Final documentation with refined architecture and diagrams

### 📁 **New Iteration Output Files**
- `cost-aware-refinement-iteration-N-*.md`: Detailed iteration reports with satisfaction breakdown
- `cost-aware-refinement-final-report-*.md`: Final refinement summary with convergence analysis
- **Preserved Diagrams**: Visual diagrams updated with each iteration for comparison

### 🎨 **Improved User Experience**
- **Real-Time Satisfaction Tracking**: Console shows WAF/Cost/Risk breakdown during refinement
- **Convergence Feedback**: Clear messaging when target achieved or minimal improvement detected
- **Iteration Transparency**: Detailed logging of improvements and refinement reasoning

### 🚀 **Expected Outcomes**
- Architectures consistently achieve 8.5+/10 satisfaction scores
- Cost optimization insights automatically incorporated into final designs
- Risk mitigation strategies baked into architecture rather than afterthoughts
- Visual diagrams accurately reflect cost-optimized and risk-mitigated architectures

### 📊 **Scoring Formula**
```
Satisfaction = (WAF/10 × 0.40) + (Cost × 0.30) + (Risk × 0.30)

Where:
- WAF: Normalized from 0-100 to 0-10
- Cost: Extracted from cost analysis (reserved instances +1.5, optimizations +2, ROI +0.5, quick wins +1)
- Risk: Based on critical/high risk count (no critical = 8-10, critical present = 2-3)
```
