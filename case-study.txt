Case Study: Migros Switzerland - Data Sovereignty in Azure
Context
Migros, Switzerland's largest retailer (CHF 32B revenue, 100K employees), operates retail stores, Migros Bank, healthcare (Medbase), and serves 3.2M Cumulus loyalty members. Currently running mixed infrastructure across 3 Swiss data centers and multi-cloud (AWS Frankfurt, Google Z端rich) with 2.5PB structured and 8PB unstructured data.
Challenge
Switzerland's new Federal Data Protection Act (nFADP) and FINMA banking regulations require complete data sovereignty. Migros must consolidate all operations in Switzerland while enabling AI/ML analytics for their Cumulus program and maintaining 24/7 operations for retail and banking. The Swiss public demands data remains in Switzerland, especially for Migros Bank (strict FINMA) and Medbase (health data).
Key Requirements:

100% Swiss data residency for personal/financial/health data
Real-time analytics for 3.2M Cumulus members
Integration between retail and Migros Bank (FINMA compliant)
<50ms latency for POS transactions
Support 5x traffic spikes during promotions

Constraints

Regulatory: nFADP, FINMA Circular 2018/3, Swiss Banking Act, Health Insurance Act (KVG)
Technical: Cannot migrate all systems at once, 300+ supplier EDI integrations
Political: Swiss job protection, "Swissness" brand value, cooperative member trust
Financial: CHF 5M budget, Azure Switzerland costs 30% premium

Your Task (15 minutes)
1. Architecture Design (40%)
Design a solution using Azure Switzerland (Z端rich North + Geneva West) that:

Guarantees data sovereignty with clear boundaries
Enables AI/ML without data leaving Switzerland
Integrates Migros Bank with retail (FINMA compliant)
Handles 10x traffic spikes while maintaining sovereignty

2. Compliance Strategy (30%)

Map data types to residency requirements
Design controls for cross-border supplier data flows
Address Migros Bank's enhanced FINMA requirements
Create audit trail for regulatory proof

3. Migration Approach (30%)

Prioritize which systems migrate first (quick wins)
Define hybrid connectivity during transition
Ensure zero downtime for 24/7 operations
Calculate sovereignty premium vs. functionality trade-offs

Specific Scenarios
A. Cumulus AI Analytics: Marketing wants to use AI for personalized offers using purchase history that includes health (Medbase) and financial (Bank) products. How do you enable this while ensuring data never leaves Switzerland?
B. EU Supplier Integration: 200+ EU suppliers need real-time inventory sync. How do you enable data exchange while maintaining Swiss sovereignty?
C. Disaster Recovery: Primary Z端rich region fails during peak promotion. How do you failover to Geneva while maintaining data residency?
Available Azure Switzerland Services
Z端rich North (Primary): Full compute, storage, networking, Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, AKS, Azure ML, Key Vault
Geneva West (DR): Limited compute, storage focus, backup services
Note: Some Azure services unavailable in CH regions - consider workarounds
