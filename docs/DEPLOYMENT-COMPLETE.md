# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT READY: Multi-Agent Interview System

## ✅ SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL

Your Microsoft Cloud & AI Solution Engineer interview system is **complete and tested**!

---

## 🎯 TWO DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### OPTION 1: LOCAL SYSTEM (READY NOW) ⚡
Your TypeScript multi-agent system is **fully operational** and ready to use immediately:

**Quick Start:**
```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
npm run quick
```

**System Test:**
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key" npm test
```

---

### OPTION 2: AZURE AI FOUNDRY (MANUAL SETUP) 🏗️
For the full Azure AI Foundry experience, manually create these 6 agents:

**Setup Files Created:**
- `AZURE-AGENTS-SETUP.md` - First 3 agents (orchestrator, requirements, architecture)
- `AGENTS-PART2.md` - Last 3 agents (cost, risk, documentation)

**Process:**
1. Go to: https://ai.azure.com/projectdashboard/kapodeistria-1337
2. Create each agent using the definitions in the setup files
3. Copy-paste Name, Description, Instructions for each
4. Set all models to "gpt-4"
