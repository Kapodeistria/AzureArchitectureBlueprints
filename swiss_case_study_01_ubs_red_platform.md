# Case Study: UBS - UBS Red AI Platform for Swiss Wealth Management

## Context
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank and world's largest wealth manager ($5 trillion AUM, 115,000 employees globally), operates from headquarters in Zurich serving 2.5M wealth management clients. Following Credit Suisse acquisition in 2023, UBS manages combined 60,000+ investment documents, petabytes of Swiss client data, and complex multi-divisional operations. Bank processes millions of client interactions daily across Personal & Corporate Banking, Wealth Management Switzerland, Global Wealth Management divisions while maintaining strict Swiss data residency.

## Challenge
Swiss FINMA regulations, revised Federal Data Protection Act (nFADP), and Swiss Banking Act require absolute data sovereignty within Swiss borders. UBS must digitize and make searchable 60,000+ investment advisory documents while maintaining 100% Swiss data residency, reduce client advisor preparation time from hours to minutes, and enable AI-powered insights without compromising Swiss banking secrecy. Critical need to serve 30,000+ employees across Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Singapore with consistent AI performance while ensuring Swiss client data never leaves Switzerland.
