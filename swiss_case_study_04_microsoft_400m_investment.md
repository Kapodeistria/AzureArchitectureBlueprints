# Case Study: Microsoft Switzerland - $400M AI Infrastructure Expansion

## Context
Microsoft Switzerland, operating since 1989 (1,000 employees, 4,600 partners), announced $400M investment in June 2025 to expand Swiss cloud and AI infrastructure. Currently serves 50,000+ Swiss organizations (up from 30 in 2019), operating 4 data centers across Zürich and Geneva regions. Platform now offers 500+ Azure services locally (up from 50 at launch), with Azure OpenAI usage increasing significantly since mid-2023. Switzerland ranks 2nd globally in GitHub AI contributor share, with 31% of Microsoft users engaging AI tools.

## Challenge
Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (nFADP), cantonal regulations, and EU compliance requirements demand complete data sovereignty. Microsoft must serve explosive AI demand with 80% of Swiss leaders viewing 2025 as pivotal for AI adoption, support Switzerland's position as global innovation hub while maintaining data residency, and enable 1 million Swiss citizens with AI skills by 2027. Critical need to upgrade infrastructure with advanced GPUs while maintaining 100% renewable energy commitment and supporting Swiss startup ecosystem.

### Key Requirements
- Upgrade 4 data centers with advanced AI GPUs
- Maintain 100% data residency for regulated sectors
- Support 50,000+ customers with scaling AI needs
- Enable Swiss AI Tech Accelerator program
- Train 1 million Swiss citizens by 2027
- Partner with Switzerland Innovation Parks network

### Constraints
- **Regulatory**: Swiss data sovereignty, FINMA for finance, health data regulations
- **Infrastructure**: 35% premium for Swiss operations vs EU regions
- **Sustainability**: 100% renewable energy requirement, carbon neutrality goals
- **Skills Gap**: 48% of leaders cite AI skilling as top challenge

## Your Task (20 minutes)

### 1. Infrastructure Architecture (40%)
Design the $400M expansion strategy that:
- Deploys advanced GPU infrastructure across 4 centers
- Enables 10x AI workload scaling
- Maintains 100% renewable energy
