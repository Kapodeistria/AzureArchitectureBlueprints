# Case Study: BKW - Windows 365 Virtual Desktop Transformation

## Context
BKW, Swiss energy and infrastructure company (CHF 3.8B revenue, 11,000 employees), provides integrated solutions across energy, buildings, and infrastructure. Following rapid growth acquiring 100+ companies in 5 years, operates across tens of locations globally from city offices to remote energy facilities. Company focuses on sustainable energy solutions, decarbonization, and enabling Switzerland's energy transition while managing complex portfolio spanning public utilities to engineering services.

## Challenge
Swiss Energy Act, federal infrastructure regulations, and public sector requirements demand secure, compliant IT infrastructure. BKW must support dramatically expanded workforce after 100 acquisitions without proportional IT growth, enable employees from urban offices to remote wind farms and construction sites, and modernize end-of-life on-premises infrastructure struggling with scale. Platform must support highly diverse workforce from engineers to energy traders while maintaining public sector security standards.

### Key Requirements
- Enable 11,000 employees across dozens of global locations
- Support workforce that grew 5x through acquisitions
- Provide consistent experience from office to field sites
- Maintain public sector security and compliance
- Scale rapidly without infrastructure investment
- Enable true hybrid working model post-pandemic

### Constraints
- **Regulatory**: Swiss public sector requirements, energy sector compliance
- **Technical**: Legacy on-prem infrastructure at capacity, diverse acquired IT systems
- **Operational**: Employees in remote locations with limited connectivity
- **Cultural**: Traditional utility transitioning to modern energy company

## Your Task (20 minutes)

### 1. Architecture Design (40%)
Design Windows 365 solution that:
- Replaces end-of-life on-premises VDI
- Scales for rapid acquisition-driven growth
- Works reliably in remote energy facilities
- Maintains Swiss public sector compliance

### 2. Cloud Migration Strategy (30%)
- Transition from on-premises to cloud-first approach
- Integrate diverse systems from 100 acquisitions
- Ensure zero disruption to energy operations
- Implement modern workplace for all employees

### 3. Change Management (30%)
- Enable workforce unfamiliar with cloud
- Support field workers with limited IT skills
- Drive adoption across merged companies
- Maintain productivity during transition

## Specific Scenarios

### A. Remote Wind Farm Access
Engineer at Alpine wind farm with limited connectivity needs full desktop access to run complex modeling software. How does Windows 365 provide reliable experience?

### B. Acquisition Integration
Newly acquired engineering firm with 200 employees needs immediate integration. How to onboard quickly without infrastructure deployment?

### C. Energy Trading Continuity
Energy traders need 24/7 access to trading platforms during Swiss grid emergency. How does solution ensure zero downtime?
